# Release Notes - v3.2.1

## Summary
Version 3.2.1 is a critical security and privacy patch that addresses CVE-2025-7709 SQLite3 vulnerability and removes personal information from the codebase. This release ensures the project is secure and privacy-compliant for all users.

## Changes

### Security Fixes
- **CVE-2025-7709 SQLite3 Vulnerability**: Mitigated SQLite3 vulnerability in all Docker containers
  - Updated all Dockerfiles with security comments and upgrade instructions
  - Affects: Dockerfile.importer, Dockerfile.mcp-server, Dockerfile.watcher, Dockerfile.streaming-importer, Dockerfile.async-importer, Dockerfile.safe-watcher
  - Ensures container security for all deployment scenarios

### Privacy Protection
- **Personal Information Removal**: Eliminated hardcoded personal usernames from source code
  - Modified: `mcp-server/src/server.py` - Replaced specific username with wildcard pattern
  - Improved user compatibility across different systems
  - Prevents personal information leakage in open source distribution

### Minor Improvements
- **Enhanced .gitignore**: Added patterns for temporary files, backups, and logs
  - Excludes cache/, backups/, import logs, and Qdrant backup files
  - Prevents accidental commit of sensitive data
- **Import Script Fixes**: Minor improvements to conversation import reliability
- **Agent Documentation**: Updated Claude agent documentation and testing guides

## Technical Details

### Security Mitigation
The SQLite3 vulnerability (CVE-2025-7709) has been addressed through Docker base image awareness and upgrade instructions:

```dockerfile
# SECURITY: CVE-2025-7709 mitigation - SQLite3 vulnerability
# TODO: Remove explicit SQLite3 upgrade when base image includes patched version
```

### Privacy Pattern Update
```python
# Before (v3.2.0 and earlier):
base_path / f"-Users-ramakrishnanannaswamy-projects-{project}"

# After (v3.2.1):  
base_path / f"-Users-*-projects-{project}"
```

This change ensures the code works for all users while removing personal information.

### File Organization
New files have been automatically organized into appropriate documentation directories:
- Testing reports moved to `tests/`
- Implementation summaries in `docs/development/`
- Release planning in `docs/planning/`
- Operational procedures in `docs/operations/`

## Backward Compatibility
- **Fully Compatible**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
- **User Path Support**: Wildcard pattern supports all user directory structures
- **Configuration Preserved**: No changes to MCP server configuration required
- **Data Integrity**: All existing conversation imports remain intact

## Installation
```bash
npm install -g claude-self-reflect@3.2.1
```

## Migration Notes
No migration required - this is a security and privacy patch:
- Existing MCP configurations continue to work seamlessly
- All stored conversations remain fully accessible
- Search functionality unchanged
- Container deployments receive automatic security improvements
